The "Product Group Order" extension is a powerful tool that enables users to automatically generate orders based on product-group rules. With this extension, you can standardize bundles, enforce required add-ons, and complete client setups exactly when needed. Here are the key features of the "Product Group Order" extension:

1. **Rule-Based Ordering from Product Groups:** Define what a client must already have (*applies\_to*), what is required (*requires*), and which billing cycles are allowed. The extension turns these rules into consistent, compliant orders.
2. **Per-Client Service Analysis:** The extension scans each client’s existing products and addons, maps billing cycles, and pinpoints exactly what’s missing to complete the set.
3. **Cycle-Aware Matching:** Ensure accuracy by requiring at least one allowed billing cycle for every required product before an order is created.
4. **On-Demand Order Creation &amp; Auto-Provisioning:** Create the order via WHMCS Local API with your chosen payment method; the module triggers provisioning (AcceptOrder, autosetup) so services are delivered promptly and efficiently.
5. **Products and Addons Support:** Apply rules across both products and addons to build complete, sellable bundles.

By giving you the power to convert grouping rules into precise, on-demand orders, the "Product Group Order" extension provides unparalleled control over how bundles are completed. You no longer have to rely on manual checks—initiate compliant, cycle-correct orders whenever you choose.

It does not disrupt your existing services or schedules; instead, it enhances your sales flow by adding only the necessary items to fulfill your defined rules.

Automated ordering and provisioning let you closely monitor outcomes and ensure orders complete successfully. If any issues arise, you can address them immediately—keeping operations smooth and clients satisfied.

By enabling rule-driven ordering, per-client analysis, cycle-aware matching, and one-click order + auto-provisioning, this "Product Group Order" extension becomes an indispensable tool for optimizing your WHMCS sales efficiency and revenue growth.
